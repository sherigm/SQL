# Sherry Moua's SQL Portfolio

## Hello and thank you for visiting my SQL Portfolio. It all began with an assignment given to me by my current Supervisor. Myself and another colleague were tasked with redeveloping an existing program. We were handed a big Excel spreadsheet that contained data from 2009 to 2021. Learning Excel was challenging at first, but after I understood and acquired more about pivotal charts, I was astounded by the data collected. I must admit that after nearly a year, I was still thinking about the work, and now here I am, ready to go on another fascinating voyage.  I'm now studying SQL, Tableau, and, perhaps, Python. My code repository contains examples that I have written. Please take a look around and contact me if you have any questions. at sherimoua17@gmail.com
